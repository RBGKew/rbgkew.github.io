All the cool data we access

Statistics about new plant names being added or old records being edited on the IPNI can be found on the statistics page [here](http://www.ipni.org/stats.html).  The data for the website are updated periodally throughout the year but is not currently dynamic.  We also keep records showing how the standardization of the data is progressing [here](http://http://www.ipni.org/standardization_charts.html).
