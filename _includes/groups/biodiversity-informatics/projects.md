### Plants of the World Online Portal

Currently under [active development](http://www.github.com/RBGkew/powop),
PoWOP aims to be A single point of access for authoritative information on
plant species.  Will include information on identification, distribution,
traits, threat status, molecular phylogenies and uses. It will utilise
Kewâ€™s extensive data resources alongside images from the digitisation
of the collections.
