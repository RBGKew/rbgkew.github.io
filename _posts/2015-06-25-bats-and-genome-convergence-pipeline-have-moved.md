title: BaTS, Befi-BaTS, SHiAT and Genome Convergence Pipeline have moved!

Important – please take note!
### Headline:###

* All my phylogenetics software is now on GitHub, not websites or Google Code
* Please use the new FAQ pages and issue/bug tracker forms, rather than emailing me directly in the first instance
* Until now, I’ve been hosting the open-sourced parts of my phylogenetics software on code.google.com. These include the BaTS (and Befi-BaTS) tools for phylogeny-trait association correlations; the alignment profilers SHiAT (and Genious Entropy plugin), and the Genome Convergence API for the Genome Convergence Pipeline and Phylogenomics Dataset Browser. However, Google announced that they are ending support for Google Code, and from August all projects will be read-only.

I’ve therefore migrated all my projects to Github. This will eventually include FAQs, forums and issue/bug tracking for the most popular software, BaTS and Genome Convergence API.

The projects can now be found at:

BaTS and Befi-BaTS: https://github.com/lonelyjoeparker/befi-bats-gui
Genome Convergence API: https://github.com/lonelyjoeparker/qmul-genome-convergence-pipeline
HIV-HADPACK: https://github.com/lonelyjoeparker/hiv-hadpack
 

I'm also changing how I respond to questions and bug requests. In the past I dealt with questions as they came in, with the odd explanatory post and a manual or readme with each release. Predictably, this meant I spent a lot of time dealing with duplicates or missing bugs or feature requests. I am now in the process of compiling a list of FAQs for each project, as well as uploading the manuals in markdown format so that I can update them with each release. Please bear with me as I go through this process. In the meantime, if you have an issue with a piece of software or think you have found a bug, please:

Make sure you have the most recent version of the software. In most cases this will be available as an executable .jarfile on the project github page.
Check the ‘Issues’ tab on the project github page. Your issue may be a duplicate, or already fixed by a new release. If your bug isn’t listed, please open a new issue giving as much detail as possible.
Check the manual and FAQs to see if anyone else has had the same problem – I may well have answered their question already.
If you still need an answer please email me on joe+bioinformaticshelp@kitserve.org.uk
Thanks so much for your support and involvement,

Joe
