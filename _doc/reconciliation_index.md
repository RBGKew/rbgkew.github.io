# Kew Reconciliation Services

## Reconciliation

_Reconciliation_ is the semi-automated process of matching text strings (like _Quercus alba_ L.) to entities in databases (like `IPNI 295763-1` or `http://ipni.org/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:295763-1`).

Kew is exposing some of our data resources through this website to encourage reconciliation against them. Once reconciled entities can be extended using other data — for example, the taxonomic status of a name, or the georeference of a specimen. They can also be more easily integrated into portals like [eMonocot](http://emonocot.org/).

## Name matching

To ensure good-quality matches a sequence of transformations is configured, specific to each service. For example, a common error in botanical names is incorrect Latin endings (_-us_ instead of _-a_). This service can take account of such problems.

## Tools

Tools exist to make using the reconciliation service straightforward. The most user-friendly is _OpenRefine_ (previously called _Google Refine_), which provides a spreadsheet interface to reconcile data and extend it using Kew’s resources. See the [help page](reconciliation_help.html) for instructions. Alternatively, CSV files can be uploaded to this website, and will be returned with identifiers added. Or, a single query can be made.

## Feedback

This is a preview service. We appreciate feedback on the interface, usage (with OpenRefine or otherwise) and quality of the matches produced. Please send any feedback to the [Biodiversity Informatics team](mailto:bi@kew.org?subject=Reconciliation%20service).
