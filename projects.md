The International Plant Names Index is not just for looking up names, take a look at these recently published papers showing how the data can be used to answer a number of different questions about botany. 

- [Fewer than three percent of land plant species named by women: Author gender over 260 years](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/iapt/tax/2015/00000064/00000002/art00003)
- [The making of world’s largest journal in systematic botany](http://biotaxa.org/Phytotaxa/article/view/phytotaxa.191.1.1)
- [Author inflation masks global capacity for species discovery in flowering plants](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.12522/abstract)
